# N:JobAssist
#### Helper library for Unity's Job System

N:JobAssist is a mini-library that help streamlining interactions with Unity's Job System through wrappers, grouping and chaining automation.
It was initially designed for [**N:ORCA**](https://github.com/Nebukam/com.nebukam.orca) & [**N:Geom**](https://github.com/Nebukam/com.nebukam.geom), but ended in its own package for practical purposes.

## Installation Troubleshooting

After installing this package, Unity may complain about missing namespace references error (effectively located in dependencies). What [Git Dependency Resolver For Unity](https://github.com/mob-sakai/GitDependencyResolverForUnity) does, instead of editing your project's package.json, is create local copies of the git repo *effectively acting as custom local packages*.
Hence, if you encounter issues, try the following:
- In the project explorer, do a ```Reimport All``` on the **Packages** folder (located at the same level as **Assets** & **Favorites**). This should do the trick.
- Delete Library/ScriptAssemblies from you project, then ```Reimport All```.
- Check the [Resolver usage for users](https://github.com/mob-sakai/GitDependencyResolverForUnity#usage)
