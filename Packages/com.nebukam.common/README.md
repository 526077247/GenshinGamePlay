## Installation Troubleshooting

After installing this package, Unity may complain about missing namespace references error (effectively located in dependencies). What [Git Dependency Resolver For Unity](https://github.com/mob-sakai/GitDependencyResolverForUnity) does, instead of editing your project's package.json, is create local copies of the git repo *effectively acting as custom local packages*.
Hence, if you encounter issues, try the following:
- In the project explorer, do a ```Reimport All``` on the **Packages** folder (located at the same level as **Assets** & **Favorites**). This should do the trick.
- Delete Library/ScriptAssemblies from you project, then ```Reimport All```.
- Check the [Resolver usage for users](https://github.com/mob-sakai/GitDependencyResolverForUnity#usage)
