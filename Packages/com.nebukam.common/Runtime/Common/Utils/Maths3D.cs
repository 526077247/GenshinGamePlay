    !!! NOTE ON PERFORMANCE

    The Unity and 3dMath functions are optimized for readability, not for performance. 
    If you need to call one or more of these functions thousands of times per frame, convert the code as described below. 
    It can lead to several orders of magnitude in performance increase, depending how often you do mathematical operations.

    //To avoid internal function call overhead, Don't use the build in vector math operations like this:
    Vector3 vector1;
    Vector3 vector2;
    Vector3 answer;
    answer = vector1 + vector2;
 
    //Instead do it manually like so:
    Vector3 vector1;
    Vector3 vector2;
    Vector3 answer;
    answer.x = vector1.x + vector2.x;
    answer.y = vector1.y + vector2.y;
    answer.z = vector1.z + vector2.z;
 
    //Same for Vector3.Dot(). Instead, do this:
    Vector3 vector1;
    Vector3 vector2;
    float dotResult;
    dotResult = vector1.x * vector2.x + vector1.y * vector2.y
 
    //The same goes for cross product, normalize, magnitude, distance, TransformPoint(), TransformDirection(), transform.right, etc.
 
    //Copying vectors can be left the same because it does not have much performance overhead.
    //So you can just do this:
    vector2 = vector1;
 
    //Other performance improvements:
    //-Do not have a large for loop with function calls to computations. Instead, group lots of computations together into one function call. 
    //-Avoid the use of "if" statements, just just math only if you can.
 
    //Here is an example of transforming physics triangles from local to world space
    void LocalToWorldSpace(Triangle triangle){
 
	    Vector3 local;
	    Vector3 right = transformRight;
	    Vector3 up = transformUp;
	    Vector3 forward = transformForward;
	    Vector3 position = transformPositionFixedUpdate;
 
	    for (int i = 0; i < triangle.Amount; i++){
 
		    local.x = from[i].x * right.x +	from[i].y * up.x + from[i].z * forward.x;
		    local.y = from[i].x * right.y +	from[i].y * up.y + from[i].z * forward.y;
		    local.z = from[i].x * right.z +	from[i].y * up.z + from[i].z * forward.z;
		    to[i].x = local.x + position.x;
		    to[i].y = local.y + position.y;
		    to[i].z = local.z + position.z;
	    }
    }
