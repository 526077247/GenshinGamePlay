# Getting Started:

Open StompyRobot/SRDebugger/Scenes/Sample.unity for a simple example scene.

## Setup

### Unity 2018 / 2019 / 2020

No setup is required. SRDebugger will automatically load at runtime unless disabled in settings. 
By default, the trigger to open the debug panel is attached to the top-left of the game view. Triple-tap there to open the panel. (This can be changed in the settings)

## Configuration

On the menu bar, click "Window/SRDebugger Settings" to open the settings pane for SRDebugger. You can set up trigger behaviour, pin entry, and more here.

# Other

- Copy log message / stack trace to clipboard (on supported platforms)

Changes:
- Improvements to UI scaling behaviour on high-dpi phone displays
- Display warning at runtime when issues are detected with log message callbacks
- Expanded input area for scroll bar on console view (easier to drag on touch screens)

1.10.0
----------

** Minimum supported version is now 2018.4 **

Features:
- New API: Custom "options containers" that can dynamically add/remove options at runtime without using reflection (i.e. no underlying C# property/method for each option).
- Support for new Unity Input System.
- (Experimental) Editor UI and script API for enabling/disabling SRDebugger. This enables you completely remove SRDebugger from builds of your game without uninstalling the plugin.

Changes:
- Added option to disable taking screenshot when making a bug report.
- Performance improvements for options tab when there are many option values changing frequently.

Fixes:
- Update SROptions window in editor when using SRDebug.Init()
- Fix errors relating to "domain reload" when entering play mode in editor.
- MissingReferenceException when using options containers while debug panel is unloaded.
- Prevent trigger from taking input focus via navigation events.
- Fix access to Unity property from background thread.

1.9.1
----------

Fixed:
- No longer auto-initializes when auto-initialization is disabled. 
- Improved support for higher levels of 'managed stripping' in AOT compiled platforms (IL2CPP)
- Fix error notifier calling native Unity methods from background thread.
- Fix number increment/decrement issues on non-english language platforms.

1.9.0
----------

Attention: If upgrading from a previous version, please see upgrade notes below.

New:
- Added a notification to the trigger whenever an error is added to the console log (disable in settings).

Changed:
- Converted to asmdef packages.
- Added note to auto-created event system to inform that it is created by SRDebugger and how to disable it.

Fixed:
- Support Domain Reload in 2019.3
- Fix settings window display in 2019.3


Upgrade Notes:

This package now uses assembly definition files (asmdef) to isolate the script assets. 
Please import this new version over your existing implementation and overwrite any modified files.

For more information on assembly definition files, see the Unity docs: 
https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ScriptCompilationAssemblyDefinitionFiles.html

The options panel (SROptions) has required some changes to support asmdef, however most user code interacting with SROptions should not require any changes.

For assistance please contact us at contact@stompyrobot.uk or post on the forums.
